What is the Max Cut Problem?

Given an undirected graph (a set of points, called vertices, connected by lines, called edges), the max cut problem asks:
How can we split the graph’s vertices into two groups so that as many edges as possible go between the groups?
Each edge that connects a vertex in group 1 to a vertex in group 2 is said to be “cut” by the partitio
